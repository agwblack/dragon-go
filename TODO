# TODO list
# #########
#
#   Fix remaining issues with Login and GamesList activities
#               
#   Design layout (based on ABS)
#   Figure out how to store data and populate Lists
#     Probably a ContentProvider and SQL database.
#       Look up User in the database and get his GamesList. Then compare with
#       what the server says and update accordingly.
#
#   GamesListPager should be the opening Activity. It immediately checks for logged
#   in User and if it can't find one it goes to Login Activity. We thus need a
#   way for the app to remember who is logged in, option to automatically
#   remember login details, etc.
#
# Implement optional automatic Status update check
#   Using a service.
#   Probably one service that performs the check and updates if necessary and
#   then ends. This is also used by the refresh button and when we login/open
#   the GamesList Activity.
#   Another service which runs indefinitely (until the app is killed?) and
#   calls the first service periodically.
#
# Create a BoardView 
#   probably using a GridLayout/GridView - what is the difference?
#   Alternatively a board image on top of which we place stone images as
#   appropriate.
#   Would be really cool to have a pinch view board that you can scroll around
#   Need to create some basic artwork for this
#   Should copy GoDroid in having the 2 moves prior to the most recent move
#   numbered.
